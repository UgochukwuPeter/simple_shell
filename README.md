Synopsis
We have made a simple shell that can execute files found in the path, and handle some built ins.
The format for entering a command is as follows: ls (command) -la (arguments)

Description
This version of a simple shell will execute commands that are found in the path and some built ins. All output is written to stdout, this shell can work in both interactive mode, and non-interactive mode.

Example

/tmp$ ls -l total 0 /tmp$

All files where compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
All programs and functions were compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic.
